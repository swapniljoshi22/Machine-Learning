Sales Price Adjustments shall only be made on a quarterly basis on January 1, April 1, July 1st and October 1% unless there is a significant change in conditions, in which case adjustments could be proposed more frequently by mutual agreement between Buyer and Seller. The formula for quarterly Sales Price Adjustments to the Fresh Acid Sales Price is the new quarterly price = base price + inflation + fuel + power + sulfur + labor + purge acid neutralization. A Sales Price Adjustment calculation example is provided in the attached Exhibit C. Although the Agreement specifies quantities in Net Tons, Seller agrees to invoice on an as-is basis; for Carrollton, KY Net Tons multiplied by 0.960 and for Midland, MI Net Tons multiplied by 0.932. Sales Price Adjustments are intended to reflect material increases or decreases in the Seller's cost of production of the Products provided herein and shall be in accordance with the following factors:A) Inflation Adjustment: The Fresh Acid Sales Price will be adjusted based on the change in inflation. The Inflation Adjustment Factor will be calculated using the following Index: Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI Series ID; WPUID69115, Intermediate Materials less Food and Energy, Not seasonally adjusted. The Inflation Adjustment will be calculated by multiplying the Base Price x the Inflation Adjustment Factor. The Inflation Adjustment Factor equals the average of the 12 most recent months available data (excluding Preliminary Data) of the Index as of the last week of the month preceding the adjustment date, then dividing that result by 193.18, then subtracting 1.0. The Base Price will be multiplied by the Inflation Adjustment Factor, the result of which is the Inflation Adjustment. An example of the calculation is shown in Exhibit D.B) Labor  The Fresh Acid Sales Price will be adjusted based on the change in the average base wage paid to Seller's Oregon, OH hourly manufacturing personnel including fringe benefits. The price is based on an average quarterly rate of $47.41 per hour and shall be adjusted up or down by $0.30 per Net Ton for each $0.10 per hour increase or decrease in the average base wage rate during the quarter.C) Sulfur  The Fresh Acid Sales Price will be adjusted based on the change in the cost of sulphur, and is based on the Green Markets, Fertilizer Markets Intelligence Weekly published by Pike and Fischer Publications, average Tampa sulfur quarterly price of $110.00 per long ton (2,240 pounds). The adjustment up or down to the Fresh Acid Sales Price shall be at the rate of $0.03 per Net Ton for each $1.00 per long ton increase or decrease from the $110.00 per long ton base sulfur price.D) Power  The Fresh Acid Sales Price will be adjusted based on the change in the quarterly average cost of purchased electricity at Seller's Plant, and is based on an initial cost of $0.06 per KWH. The Fresh Acid Sales Price shall be increased or decreased as the case may be at the rate of $0.10 per Net Ton for each $0.001 per KWH increase or decrease in the electricity cost of Seller above or below $0.06 per KWH.E) Fuel  The Fresh Acid Sales Price will be adjusted based on the change in the preceding quarterly average NYMEX Henry Hub, Spot Natural Gas Price. The factor will adjust from a base of $3.72 per million BTU and will be adjusted up or down at the rate of $0.40 per Net Ton for each $0.10 per million BTU increase or decrease in the preceding quarterly average NYMEX Henry Hub Spot Natural Gas Price per million BTU.F) Purge Acid Neutralization - The Fresh Acid Sales Price will be adjusted based on the change in the cost of liquid caustic soda delivered to Sellers Plant for the purpose of neutralizing Buyer's Spent Acid that is not decomposed. The neutralization charge per Net Ton shall be Seller's total cost of caustic neutralization divided by the total tons of spent acid received at Seller's Plant in a quarter. The current cost of neutralization is approximately $4.75 per Net Ton. 5. DELIVERIES, TRANSPORTATION CHARGES5.1 Product Deliveries: Delivery of Fresh Acid from and Spent Acid to, Sellers Plant will be in Buyers tank trucks, either Buyer-owned tank trucks or a Buyer-designated third party common carrier. In either case, all equipment and drivers shall meet Seller's requirements, including respecting safety and operational requirements. Buyer shall be responsible and provide all necessary receiving, loading and unloading services for al! Products5.2. Buyer shall be responsible for transportation of all Products and all charges therefor. 6. TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS 6.1 Title to Fresh Acid sold, and the risk of loss thereof, shall pass to Buyer when it passes out of Sellers storage system to Buyers or Buyer's designated carrier's tank truck at Seller's Plant. Seller assumes all risk of loss of Fresh Acid prior to title transfer. Title to Spent Acid delivered, and the risk of loss thereof, shall pass to Seller when it passes into Sellers storage system from Buyers or Buyer's designated carrier's delivery equipment at Seller's Plant. Buyer assumes all risk of loss of Spent Acid prior to title transfer.6.2 Compliance with Laws.

In addition, any combination of features shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party, but only if the combination itself and its principle of operation are in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party.15.3 Receiving Party expressly agrees to receive process, use, transfer, or otherwise handle any data from Disclosing Party containing personal data solely to the limited extent necessary to meet its obligations under this Agreement in a confidential manner and in accordance with applicable law. Receiving Party warrants that its employees, representatives, agents, subcontractors act in accordance with this Agreement.

Alternatively, Seller may demonstrate that it is meeting the applicable supply chain security criteria by completing a risk assessment provided by Buyer. Should Seller fail to provide evidence of such certification and compliance, or fail to achieve a satisfactory rating on Buyer's risk assessment, then Buyer may terminate this Agreement, upon sixty (60) day advanced written notice, during which Seller may cure such failure. 18.
